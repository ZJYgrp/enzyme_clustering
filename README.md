# enzyme_clustering
The script is designed to perform clustering analysis on snapshots taken along the MD snapshots. 
The first part of the code involves testing what number of clusters best provide the best performace.
The second part of the code performs clustering on the optimal number of clusters, documents the cluster indexes, 
print the clusters that are closest to the center, perform and plot PCA, and average the structures.
